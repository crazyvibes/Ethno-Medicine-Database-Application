# Description
Ethnomedicine is a study or comparison of the traditional medicine practiced by various ethnic groups, and especially by indigenous peoples. Ethnomedicine refers to a wide range of healthcare systems/structures, practices, beliefs, and therapeutic techniques that arise from indigenous cultural development. Ethnomedicine is concerned with the cultural interpretations of health, disease and illness and also addresses the health care-seeking process and healing practices. Ethnomedicine and the history of medicine have in common the description of medical systems, whereby the separation is geographical in the former case and historical in the latter case.

# Availibility
The geographical area that is being fixed for our research is the Indian Subcontinent. It is the seventh largest country in the world and a demo continent to itself because of the geograpical diversities. So, from around 45000 species of trees, there are approximately 3000 documented plant species which can be used as medicines. But the traditional practitioners use more than 6000 plant species and hence the famous treatment of Ayurveda came into picture. Therefore, we are documenting ethnomedicinal plants which can further help in developing new medicines and will be re-used once more. Hence we unfold the details about the other prospects of this database.”

# Database
Hereby, we produce a database of such medicines and their following characteristics with an appropriate front end to view the data. This is the first database that is being designed on Indian ethnobiological plants. It is a comprehensive database which provides extensive information of medicinal plants which include Botanical name, Family, Local Indian Name, Taxonomy Id, PubMed id, Habit, Ailments Treated, Chemical Composition, Phytochemicals, Parts use, References and Plant Location in India, Annotated medicinal plants integrated in the current version of database were collected from the existing books, databases and the available literatures in PubMed. Current version of IEMDB contains the 1,000 records of medicinal plants belongs to 120 plant families. We anticipate that available information in the database would help the users to readily search the desired information.

# Usability
The components of ethnomedicine have long been ignored by many biomedical practitioners for various rea- sons. For example, the chemical composition, dosages and toxicity of the plants used in ethnomedicine are not clearly defined. However, it is interesting to note that the ethnomedicinal uses of plants is one of the most successful criteria used by the pharmaceutical industry in finding new therapeutic agents for the various fields of biomedicine. Today about 80% of the world’s population rely pre- dominantly on plants and plant extracts for healthcare According to data released by the World Health Organization (WHO), ethnomedicine has maintained its popularity in all regions of the developing world and its use is rapidly expanding in the industrialized countries.”

# Tools and Techniques Used
FRONT- END DEVELOPMENT:
Front end development is mostly focused on what some may coin the "client side" of development. Front end developers will be engaged in analysing code, design, and debugging applications along with ensuring a seamless user experience. We manage what people first see in their browser. As a front end developer we are responsible for the look, feel and ultimately design of the site.

HTML:
When we write a normal document using a word processor like Microsoft Word/Office, our text is saved in a file with a special format. It is not simply saved as the string of words we typed since the document needs to preserve things like the font you chose, the size of the text, which words are in bold, which italics, and so on. The special format includes not only our words, but all these extra information so that the next time Word opens our document, it can display the document with the exact appearance we created earlier.
In the same way, web pages are simply strings of words put in a special format that web browsers are able to display. While the format of Word documents is simply called "Word format" (or "doc format"), loosely speaking, one might say that web pages are formatted using "HTML". 
According to formal definition, Hyper Text Markup Language is, as the name suggests, a markup language which is used to present the data on the web. A markup language is a language that is used to highlight the core text and provide it a structure. Here the markup is used to specify hypertext i.e. text which is a link to another resource such a page or a document. So, to convert a text document to HTML you must mark it with appropriate tags to specify it's structure.

CSS:
Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, allow us to specify things like the font you want on your page, the size of your text, whether the page is to have 2 columns, whether our text is to be in bold or italics, and so on.
 In other words, it is the part that lets we control the appearance of our web page. We may be used to the Microsoft Word "doc" format, where everything from the text we type to the appearance of the document is specified in a single file, transparent to us. On the web, the raw information is specified in HTML and most of the appearance is determined by the CSS. 
Or Cascading Style Sheets are, as the name suggests, style sheets that provide styling to the already structured HTML structure. They're called cascading because the styles specified can be inherited and overridden on the basis of the structure of the HTML document., 

Bootstrap:
Bootstrap is an open-source framework for developing website based on HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is the most widely use framework for developing responsive, mobile first web project.
Bootstrap make it easier to layout web pages, it simplify CSS and the bulk of functionality we look for as a developer are already built for us and all you only requires is to add classes to HTML elements and a bit of Structure.
JavaScript:
JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to manipulate both HTML and CSS using conditions and events. Consider that it HTML is the human body, CSS is the clothing and JS is event based set of functions or a macro that specifies the changes in the HTML and CSS from time to time.

JQuery:
JQuery is a popular JavaScript library that provides an extensive framework of objects and functions that let you query and work with HTML pages with so much easy. JQuery is also very powerful as it provide jQuery.ajax method for HTTP request and also present an easy way to use browser API and third-party API.
With jQuery we are empowered to do more and code less as a front-end Javascript web developer writing code that can run across any web browser.


BACK-END DEVELOPMENT
The back end comprises three parts: the server, our database, any APIs, and a back-end web application, software written via server-side languages.
The server is a powerful computer that runs the back-end software, the database houses our site’s data, and the software communicates between the two. For example, if a user is searching a plant details on this site, the server-side scripts will gather the information the user enters, the application will process it on the server, then interact with the Ethno Medicine database to find that information there.
Server-side scripts are used by back-end web to build the back-end software of a website—the mechanics we don’t see, but that make a site’s usability and functionality possible. These languages create the communication channel between user, server, and database. Anything that isn’t explicitly written into the text mark-up of a site is front-end or back-end software. Any data that a user requests in the browser (e.g., the fields in drop-down menus, photos, or user profiles) is delivered via server-side scripts, which create a channel between server and end user that requests, edits, and deletes things in the database. In the browser, front-end scripts make that information available to the user.

PHP:
The most popular server-side language on the web, PHP is designed to pull and edit information in the database. It’s most commonly bundled with databases written in the SQL language. PHP was designed strictly for the web and remains one of the most widely used languages around. It’s easy to install and deploy, is staying competitive with lots of modern frameworks, and is the foundation for a number of content-management systems. PHP-powered sites: WordPress, Wikipedia, Facebook etc. 

MySQL:
 MySQL is a fast, easy to use relational database. It is currently the most popular open-source database. It is very commonly used in conjunction with PHP scripts to create powerful and dynamic server-side applications. MySQL runs the back-end databases of some famous websites, including Wikipedia, Google and Facebook- a testament to its stability and robustness despite its decentralized, free-for-all philosophy.
